# Projects of OpenAI Request for Research 2.0

Experiments on projects proposed by OpenAI's [Requests for Research 2.0](https://blog.openai.com/requests-for-research-2/). 

## Projects

### Xor-lstm

Train an LSTM to solve the XOR problem: that is, given a sequence of bits, determine its parity. The LSTM should consume the sequence, one bit at a time, and then output the correct answer at the sequenceâ€™s end.

#### Run
run `xor-lstm.ipynb` with jupytor notebok.
